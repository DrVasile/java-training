# Test Driven Development (TDD)
- A discipline
- By writing the tests first, the code will be less coupled.
- Create a suite of tests that guarantees that the program can be deployed.

## The three laws
It is not allowed to write: 
- any production code unless it is to make a failing test pass.
- more than a test that it is sufficient to fail.
- any more production code that is sufficient to make the failing test pass.
