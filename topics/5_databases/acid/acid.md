# ACID
- Atomicity: Either the whole transaction succeeds or not at all.
- Consistency: The data will be consistent and valid according to the constraints, cascades or triggers.
- Isolation: The transactions will execute independently and in sync.
- Durability: Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain in the system.

## Overview
- A set of rules that guarantee that database transactions are performed / processed reliably.
- One of concerns is how a database recovers from a failure while performing transactions.
